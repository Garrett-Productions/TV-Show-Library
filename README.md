This application was built to complete and pass my Python exam at Coding Dojo. This website uses Python and flask on the backend, MySQL for the database, HTML and bootstrap's front end library to create the front end. This site allows users to go into a platform to post about their favorite T.V. shows and movies and basic information about them, for example; when the show/movie was created, a short description ans basic information about the film. Users have the ability to update their postings and make changes directly to the content that they've posted, utilizing all CRUD components and updating the Database.
